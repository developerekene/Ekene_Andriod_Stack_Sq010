     * Three Types of Collection
     * There are three generic types of collection: ordered lists, dictionaries/maps, and sets.
     * Ordered lists allows the programmer to insert items in a certain order and retrieve those items in the same order. An example is a waiting list. The base interfaces for ordered lists are called List and Queue.
     * Dictionaries/Maps store references to objects with a lookup key to access the object's values. One example of a key is an identification card. The base interface for dictionaries/maps is called Map.
     * Sets are unordered collections that can be iterated and contain each element at most once. The base interface for sets is called Set.
